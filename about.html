	QuoteApp is one of Anayo Oleru's mini projects. QuoteApp takes your inputed quotes and display them randomly. You can place in as many inputs as possible, and display them to see. QuoteApp automatically adds apostrophe for you, you don't need to add that. 
	You can reach me on <a href="#">Anayo Oleru</a>
